# fileConvert
Allows the user to convert text file extensions
This is a python program that allows the user to specify a directory, file, file type, and convertion goal
The program does not yet allow for a directory specification, that will be updated in the near future
This program isn't meant to change the world, instead it's an opportuinity for me to showcase and update the github community with my progress in learning Python
